## Hi there! 👋

I'm a developer who enjoys building practical tools and utilities across different domains.

### 👨‍💻 My Journey

My development journey started in 2016 creating C# plugins for the game Unturned. From those early modding days, I expanded into desktop applications and gradually explored new languages—picking up Python for its versatility, then falling in love with Rust's performance and safety guarantees.

Over the years, I've built up expertise in source control, hosting, networking, and DevOps practices. Most of the practical tools I maintain today have been developed in the past 12-16 months, reflecting my evolution into a near full-stack developer.

### 🔧 What I Work On

- **Developer Tools**: Creating utilities to streamline workflows and solve common problems
- **Data Processing**: Tools for dataset classification and data collection
- **Web Services**: Building lightweight, self-hostable applications
- **Game Development**: Unity utilities and tools
